# spot_the_difference1
This is a "Spot the Difference" game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to compare two images and identify differences between them by clicking on the areas of the images. The differences are dynamically defined in a JSON configuration file.

Game Features:
Two images are displayed side-by-side.
Players identify the differences between the two images by clicking on the areas that appear different.
The differences are highlighted once clicked.
The score increases as the player finds each difference.
A success message appears once all differences are found.
Bonus Features:
Timer functionality (to be added).
Responsive design for mobile devices.
Sound effects or animations for better interactivity (to be added).
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have the following structure in your project directory:
/images: Folder containing the images for comparison.
index.html: Main HTML file.
styles.css: CSS for styling the game.
script.js: JavaScript that contains the game logic.
data.json: JSON file that holds the game data and differences.
Running the Game:
Open the index.html file in a browser.
You will see two images displayed side-by-side.
Click on the differences between the two images to spot them.
The score will update as you find the differences.
Once all differences are found, you will get a success message.

  "gameTitle": "Spot the Difference - Animals",
  "images": {
    "image1": "./images/image11.jpg",
    "image2": "./images/image22.jpg"
  },
  "differences": [
    { "x": 65, "y": 365, "width": 25, "height": 25 },
    { "x": 300, "y": 145, "width": 30, "height": 30 },
    { "x": 180, "y": 110, "width": 25, "height": 25 }
  ]
}
How the Game Works:
When the player clicks on an image, the JavaScript captures the click coordinates and checks if they match any predefined differences.
If a match is found, the difference area is highlighted, and the score is updated.
The game continues until all differences are found, at which point a success message is displayed.
